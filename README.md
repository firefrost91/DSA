01.Bubble sort in Linked list and check_sort in Linked list

02.Creating Linked list and inserting element at any given index  

03.Insertion Sort 

04.Iterative Merge sort 

05.Merging two sorted subarrays and store them again in the same Array 

06.Merging two sorted Arrays in a single sorted array 

07.Implementation of Queue ADT using array ( enqueue , dequeue , front , create , last operations)

08.Implementation of Queue using two stacks 

09.Implementation of Recursive Binary search 

10.Recursive Merge sort 

11.Implementation of Stack ADT ( push . pop , display , create operations ) 

12.Implementation of Iterative Binary Search

13.Insertion in Circular linked list ( at end  , at first , at any index ) 

14.Insertion in Doubly linked list (at end , at first , at any index ) 

15.Insertion in circular Doubly linked list (at end , at first , at any index )

16.Merging two sorted Linked lists in a single sorted  linked list 

17.Merging two unsorted Linked lists in  a single sorted linked list 

18.Iterative and Recursive methods to measure the size of linked list 

19.Iterative and Recursive search methods in Linked list 

20.Reversing a singly linked list 

21.To check if Linked list is palindrome or not 

22.To find nth Node from end in a Linked list 

23.Inserting an element in  a Max Heap 

24.Insertion sort 

25.Recursive Quick Sort with last element as pivot

26.Recursive Quick sort with first element as pivot 

27.Iterative Quicksort with last element as pivot 

28.Hybrid of Insertion sort and Quicksort with explicit stack - Quicksort occurs till Stack size S and then insertion sort works

32.Linear hashing 

33.Linear Probing - Hashing collision resolution
